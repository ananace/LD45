*Unnamed* LD45
==============

This is my LD45 entry, theme is *Start with nothing*.

A space trading / exploration game, where you start with nothing and slowly
build your way toward a galactic trading fleet.

Requirements
------------

This project has been developed with SFML 2.5.1 and GCC 8.2.0

A C++17 supporting compiler is required, and a reasonably modern SFML install
is also a plus.
